## Framework-agnostic core developer experience for Visual Studio Code

Everything you need to write, maintain, preview, and deploy HTML, CSS/SASS/SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript in Visual
Studio Code without tearing your hair out. Over 150 hand-picked extensions long-used and relied upon by the curator in
his daily work â€” a testament to the unique value of each extension and the incredible contribution of the open source
community in together creating an exceptional developer experience in VS Code.
